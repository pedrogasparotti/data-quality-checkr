## Quick Navigation

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [SQL Guide](docs/sql/README.md) | Query patterns, optimization, window functions |
| [Python & PySpark](docs/python/README.md) | Data processing with Python ecosystem |
| [Pipeline Patterns](docs/pipelines/README.md) | ETL/ELT design and orchestration |
| [Data Quality](docs/data-quality/README.md) | Validation, testing, and monitoring |
| [CLI Tools](docs/cli/README.md) | Essential command-line references |
| [Architecture](docs/architecture/README.md) | Data platform design patterns |

## Core Principles

1. **Data Quality First** - Validate early, validate often
2. **Idempotency** - Operations should be safely repeatable
3. **Observability** - Log, monitor, alert on everything
4. **Schema Evolution** - Plan for change from day one
5. **Documentation** - If it's not documented, it doesn't exist
